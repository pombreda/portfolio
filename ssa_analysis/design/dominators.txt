Finding Dominators

To construct SSA form, we need to compute the dominator tree of the CFG.
Since we already have a generic data-flow solver, we use the iterative
method to compute the dominator sets of nodes. Construction of the dominator
tree from these dominance sets is simple. Note that the dominance set of a
node in the dominator tree is the set of nodes on the path through the tree
from the root to the node. The immediate dominator of the node shares the
exact same path, except for the last node. Since the common prefix is a 
path in a tree, it terminates uniquely on a single node. So, iff idom(b) = a,
then, dom(a) = dom(b) - a. The equality allows an efficient algorithm for
finding the unique immediate dominator of a node, by hashing from dominance
sets to basic block structures.

Once we have the dominator tree (implicitly, from the idom's), we use
the simple algorithm given in Cooper & Torczon to compute the dominance
frontier of each node.
